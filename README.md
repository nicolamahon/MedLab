HUD OOP CA Semester1 Year2

The concept for my OOP assignment is based on a Star Trek-esque Sick Bay HUD/UI.  
The videos below give a basic demonstration of the functionality of the program and the expected user interactions.

The basic functionality of the program involves the user interacting with various parts of the display, allowing them 
to display various animations which have further interactions. 

The user is initially shown a splash screen to welcome them to the "United Federation of Planets, MedLab System".
